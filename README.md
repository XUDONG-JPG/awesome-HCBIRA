# awesome-HCBIRA
HCBIRA (Hybrid-Capture Based Immune Repertoire Analyze). This pipeline automates the processing of cfTCR sequencing data, including quality control, adapter trimming, UMI extraction, read merging, genome mapping (hg38 &amp; IMGT), extraction of poorly mapped reads, non-specific gene filtering, and downstream TCR reconstruction using TRUST4 and MiXCR.
